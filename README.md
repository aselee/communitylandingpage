## How to use

Fork the repo.

Use `npm install` inside the directory to install all the dependencies (vue, vue-router, etc).

Use `npm run serve` to begin the development server, which will hot-reload on code changes. The default address is `localhost:8080`, but the console will tell you.

Use `npm run build` to compile the project into the `/dist` folder. This is what the finished product will be like.

If you don't have `vue-cli` already and want it, use `npm install -g vue-cli`. After this, you may use `vue ui` to open up Vue's graphical user interface, which you might find easier to use.

## How to contribute

Follow the steps above to get the project running on your local computer. Make any changes/implementations you'd like then commit them to your own personal branch which you should create. If you need help with this ask on the discord.

Once you're happy with the state of your branch, create a pull request to the master branch and I'll have a look over it! :)
